# git_all_updater
Update multiple git folders at once 

## Better Description ??
If you have multiple git repositories that you use, it's hard to keep track of all the git repositories and update them manually.
This script will automatically goto all the folders present at the specified location and update all the folders

## How will this script benifit me ?
Not sure .... but the way I intend to use it is - setup a cronjob which will trigger as soon as I log on and trigger this script.

## Why did I create this script ?
I was getting bored and was tired of updating all my repositories manually


P.S. This is a shell script, so only suitable for UNIX system
